# -Offline-Integration-with-Open-Source-LLMs-using-Transformers_mini_project

### Learning Objectives
     • Understand how to use open source LLMs locally without API access.
     • Install and use the Hugging Face Transformers library locally.
     • Perform text generation using pre-trained models such as GPT-2.
     • Understand how tokenizers and model pipelines work in LLMs
### Introduction to Concept
     Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-2 are pre-trained neural networks capable ofgenerating and understanding text. 
     Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, we candownload and run these models locally without needing an API key or internet connection after the initial model download.
     This approach is ideal for offline work, local testing, or educational purposes where cloud services are unavailable.
